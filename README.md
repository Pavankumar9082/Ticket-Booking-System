MOVIE TICKET BOOKING SYSTEM
----------------------------

The Movie Ticket Booking System is a simple Core Java project designed to allow users to book movie tickets, view available movies, check seat availability, and cancel bookings. This system follows a menu-driven console interface and is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Objective:
The main goal of this project is to simulate a real-world ticket booking system, ensuring a smooth and error-free ticket reservation process while demonstrating core Java concepts such as classes, objects, collections, exception handling, and input validation.

Features:
View Available Movies â€“ Displays a list of movies with showtimes and available seats.
Book Tickets â€“ Allows users to book tickets for a selected movie.
Check Seat Availability â€“ Ensures that users do not book more tickets than available.
Cancel Tickets â€“ Provides an option to cancel previously booked tickets.
Exit System â€“ Allows users to quit the application.
Technology Used:
Programming Language: Java (Core Java)
Concepts Used: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Collections (ArrayList), Exception Handling, Input Validation
Development Environment: Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VS Code) or Command Line
Project Modules:
Movie Module â€“ Stores movie details such as name, showtime, and available seats.
Booking Module â€“ Manages ticket reservations, cancellations, and seat availability.
User Interaction Module â€“ Provides a menu-driven system for users to interact with the program.
Future Enhancements:
User Authentication â€“ Add login/signup for personalized bookings.
Graphical User Interface (GUI) â€“ Implement a GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX.
Database Integration â€“ Store movies and bookings in a database instead of memory.
Payment Gateway Simulation â€“ Include online payment methods for booking confirmation.
This project is ideal for beginners to understand OOP in Java, learn data handling with collections, and practice exception handling while building a real-world application. ðŸš€
